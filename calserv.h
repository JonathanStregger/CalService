 *    of client actions on serverdata will be reported to the client upon
 *    completion or failure.
 *    Format of data received from client is yy-mm-dd;hh:mm-hh-mm;note.
 *    Sockets are managed to allow the client to connect over port 12000.
 *    Client data is stored in a binary file named calfile of calendar data
 *    Upon exit, the previous file will be renamed and a new file of
 *    calendar data will be written before deleting the old data.
